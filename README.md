# Medium_Articles
An analysis of all data / data science related articles published on Medium in 2021

Data was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/viniciuslambert/medium-2021-data-science-articles-dataset so a big shout out to Vinicius Lambert for sourcing all of this and compiling everything.

I noticed he had already taken a pass at analyzing the article headlines and what produces the most engagement, so I shyed away from that.

Instead, this is more of an exploratory look at who the highest content-producing authors are, whether some articles get republished multiple times, differences in article tags, etc.
Certainly plenty more to explore, but I am satisfied with how deep I went here. 

All analyses were conducted in R.

Any questions / critiques are always welcome!
